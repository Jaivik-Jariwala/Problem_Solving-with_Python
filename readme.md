### *Quest 4-*
  • You are working on a project to build a custom text processing tool that reads input
  from various sources, processes the text data, and stores the results in an output file.
  As part of this project, you need to implement a robust exception handling
  mechanism to handle potential errors that may arise during the text processing.
  • The tool needs to perform the following steps:
  1. Read the input data from a file specified by the user.
  2. Process the text data by performing various operations, such as counting words,
  calculating character frequencies, and generating word clouds.
  3. Store the processed results in an output file.
  Your task is to design a Python program that incorporates appropriate exception
  handling to handle the following situations:
  1. File Not Found Error: If the user provides an invalid file path or the input file is not
  found, your program should raise a custom exception FileNotFoundError with a
  suitable error message.
  2. Invalid Input Data: During text processing, if any unexpected input data is
  encountered (e.g., non-string values or missing data), your program should raise a
  custom exception InvalidInputDataError with relevant details.
  3. Disk Space Full: If the output file cannot be written due to insufficient disk space,
  your program should raise a custom exception DiskSpaceFullError

### *Quest 5-*
  You are developing a command-line task management system for a small team of users.
  User Management:
  • Implement a user registration system where users can sign up and log in. Store user
  data in a file, including usernames and hashed passwords.

### *Quest 6-*
  Task: Household Expenses Tracker
  You have been tasked with creating a Python program to help manage household expenses.
  The program should allow family members to input their daily expenses, store them in a CSV
  file, and provide functionalities for analysis and reporting.
  1. Expense Logging: Create a Python program that allows users to input their daily
  expenses. The program should prompt the user for their name, date of the expense,
  description, and amount spent. The data should be stored in a CSV file named
  expenses.csv with columns 'Name', 'Date', 'Description', and 'Amount'.
  2. Expense Analysis: Develop a function that reads the expenses.csv file and calculates
  the total expenses for each family member. Display the total expenses for each
  member along with the average daily expense for the household.
  3. Expense Trends: Implement a feature that generates a line chart using a plotting
  library (e.g., Matplotlib) to visualize the expense trends over the last month. The xaxis should represent the dates, and the y-axis should show the cumulative expenses
  for each day.
  4. Expense Categorization: Enhance the program to allow users to categorize their
  expenses. Prompt the user to assign a category (e.g., groceries, utilities,
  entertainment) to each expense entry. Update the CSV file to include a 'Category'
  column.
  5. Expense Reporting: Create a monthly expense report by reading the data from
  expenses.csv and generating a report that includes the following:
   Total expenses for each family member for the month.
   A breakdown of expenses by category.
   A comparison of monthly expenses over different months using bar charts.
  6. Expense Budgeting: Add an option for users to set a monthly budget for each
  category. After entering expenses, the program should calculate the remaining
  budget for each category and provide a warning if the budget is exceeded.
  7. Data Backup and Restore: Implement a backup and restore feature that allows users
  to save a copy of the expenses.csv file to a backup location and restore it if needed.
  Handle cases where the file might be missing or corrupted.

### *Quest 7-*
  Write a Python program that simulates logging bank transactions for customers. 
  The program should utilize the Python logging module to log each transaction, along with a timestamp, and save this data in a log file named "bank_transactions.log" in the current working directory. 
  Requirements: User Input: 
  The program should allow the user to input bank transaction details, including the customer's name, transaction type (e.g., deposit, withdrawal), and transaction amount. 
  Validate user inputs to ensure: The transaction type is one of the following: "deposit" or "withdrawal" (case-insensitive). The transaction amount is a numeric value (float or integer). 
  If the user enters invalid data, display an error message, and ask the user to re-enter the data. 
  Logging Transactions: Log each valid transaction as an INFO-level message in the following format: 
  [TIMESTAMP] Customer: [CUSTOMER_NAME], Transaction Type: [TRANSACTION_TYPE], Amount: [TRANSACTION_AMOUNT] The timestamp should be in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS." 
  Logging to File: Save the logged transactions to a file named "bank_transactions.log" in the current working directory. Ensure that each transaction is appended to the existing log file. 
  User Feedback: After successfully logging a transaction, display a success message to the user indicating that the transaction has been recorded.

### *Quest 8-*
  You are a student working on a simple automation task for a file organization project.
  Your objective is to create a Python script that uses the subprocess library to automatically sort and organize files in a specified folder based on their file types (e.g., images, documents, music, and videos). 
  Requirements: You have a folder named "unsorted_files" containing a mix of different file types, including images, documents, music, and videos. 
  You need to create a Python script that can identify the file type of each file in the "unsorted_files" folder. 
  The script should use the subprocess library to move files to corresponding subfolders within the "sorted_files" directory. 
  For example, all image files should be moved to the "sorted_files/images" folder, document files to "sorted_files/documents," and so on. After organizing the files, the script should generate a report indicating the number of files sorted into each category. 
  Objective: Develop a Python script using the subprocess library to automate the organization of files in the "unsorted_files" folder into specific subfolders within the "sorted_files" directory based on their file types. 
  Additionally, generate a report displaying the count of files sorted into each category for easy tracking and management.
